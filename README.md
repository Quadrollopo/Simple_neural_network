# Simple_neural_network
A very tiny neural network in ~100 line of code.  
This is made by a student for educational purpose and may not be perfect, so dont expect efficency or usefullness.  
Also is runned in your cpu

## How to use it

At the end of the file you can find and modify parameters for the neural network  
the parameter `network` to set neurons for each layer.  
  
For example  `network = [8, 4, 6]` is a network with 3 layers: 8 neurons in the input layer, 4 neurons in the hidden layer and 6 neurons in the last layer
  
After setting your parameters you should also implement the `generate_input()` function and the `validation()`
